# TargetingEngineGG

This repo aims to create a targeting engine which routes campaigns to the right requests. With a focus on writing easily extensible, maintainable and reusable code.

Let's LLD right into it :)

Clean coding principles like SOLID were written by uncle Bob. And traditionally Low-Level Design (LLD) examples have been illustrated in Java, which is an OOP based language with a lot of support for adding OOP related constructs. 

Unlike java, Go is a statically typed language designed with concurrency in mind. 
It does not have classes or classical inheritance, it provides OOP like support through structs, methods, and interfaces. Go favors composition over inheritance and organizes code around packages and functions.
